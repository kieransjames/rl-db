# rl-db.com

[rl-db.com](http://rl-db.com) is a project to collect and make accessible professional Rocket League stats. I made this site as a personal project, partially out of passion for the game, partially to practice data science/engineering. 

The site is a streamlit web app hosted on AWS, coded in Python and MySQL. The 'rl_db_app' folder contains the programming relating to the app itself, while 'rl_db_backend' contains programming relating to scraping of data from ballchasing.com and the backend MySQL.
